### ðŸ’¡ 
- **Detecting Harmful Text in Online Platforms**: Developed a model that achieved 92.5% accuracy, significantly outperforming existing solutions, presented at the annual Gulf Coast Conference & Expo on AI, 2024. 
- **Air Quality Monitor**: Created a Python script that retrieves Air Quality Index (AQI) data from the OpenWeatherMap API based on user-inputted locations. The script converts the location to coordinates, retrieves the AQI, and provides the current air quality condition. It aimed to provide real-time air quality data to residents and policymakers in areas affected by industrial pollution for health and safety purposes. This project earned me 5th place on a Hackathon hosted by HCC's Computer Science Association.

### ðŸŒŸ Interests 
- **AI for Social Good**: Using AI to solve real-world problems and improve quality of life.
- **Sustainability**: Applying AI to environmental and sustainability challenges.
- **Philosophy and Ethics**: Exploring the philosophical and ethical implications of AI and technology.
