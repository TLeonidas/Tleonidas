## Hello there!

I am an Artificial Intelligence student passionate about leveraging AI for social good. Under Dell Technologies mentorship, I presented a Natural Language Processing project at a regional AI conference, focusing on detecting harmful speech on online platforms.

At HCC TV, I create content to educate audiences about AI, bridging the gap between technology and the public while addressing misconceptions and emphasizing its potential to benefit society.

**Platforms**: AWS, Azure, GitHub, Colab, Hugging Face<br>
**Languages**: Python, SQL, Linux<br>
**Architectures and Frameworks**: Transformers, CNN, PyTorch, TensorFlow<br>
**Tools and Libraries**: Numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, NLTK, OpenCV, torchvision  

- [**Detecting Harmful Text in Online Platforms**](https://huggingface.co/spaces/AIGulfCoast2024/Hate_Speech_Text_Classifier): Developed a model that achieved 92.5% accuracy, significantly outperforming existing solutions, presented at the annual Gulf Coast Conference & Expo on AI, 2024.<br>
- [**Air Quality Monitor**](https://github.com/TLeonidas/HCC-CSA-Hackathon): Created a Python script that retrieves Air Quality Index (AQI) data from the OpenWeatherMap API based on user-inputted locations. The script converts the location to coordinates, retrieves the AQI, and provides the current air quality condition. This project earned me 5th place on a Hackathon hosted by HCC's Computer Science Association.
