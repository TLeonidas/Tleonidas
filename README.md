## Hello there!

I am Tales and after seven years in the military, I am studying AI to leverage it for social good.

**Platforms**: AWS, Azure, Google Colab, SageMaker Studio Lab, Hugging Face, GitHub<br>
**Languages**: Python, SQL<br>
**Architectures and Frameworks**: PyTorch, CNN, Transformers<br>
**Tools and Libraries**: Scikit-learn, NLTK, torchvision, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Gradio  

**Detecting Harmful Text in Online Platforms**: Developed a model that achieved 92.5% accuracy, significantly outperforming existing solutions, presented at the annual Gulf Coast Conference & Expo on AI, 2024. 
(Air Quality Monitor)[https://github.com/TLeonidas/TLeonidas-HCC-CSA-April24-Hackathon]: Created a Python script that retrieves Air Quality Index (AQI) data from the OpenWeatherMap API based on user-inputted locations. The script converts the location to coordinates, retrieves the AQI, and provides the current air quality condition. It aimed to provide real-time air quality data to residents and policymakers in areas affected by industrial pollution for health and safety purposes. This project earned me 5th place on a Hackathon hosted by HCC's Computer Science Association.
