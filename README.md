## Hello there!

I am a purpose-driven professional, constantly upskilling to create meaningful impact through data.

**Platforms**: AWS, Azure, GitHub, Colab, Hugging Face<br>
**Languages**: Python, SQL, Linux<br>

**Tools and Libraries**: Numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, NLTK, OpenCV, torchvision  

- [Flower Classification with Deep Learning](https://github.com/TLeonidas/uk-flower-classification): For my final project of the AI Programming with Python by Udacity, I applied transfer learning to classify 102 species of flowers by building a custom classifier on top of a VGG16-based neural network. Achieving 85% validation accuracy, I also built a complete training and inference pipeline, including a command-line application.
- [**Detecting Harmful Text in Online Platforms**](https://huggingface.co/spaces/AIGulfCoast2024/Hate_Speech_Text_Classifier): Developed a model that achieved 92.5% accuracy, significantly outperforming existing solutions, presented at the annual Gulf Coast Conference & Expo on AI, 2024.<br>
- [**Air Quality Monitor**](https://github.com/TLeonidas/HCC-CSA-Hackathon): Created a Python script that retrieves Air Quality Index (AQI) data from the OpenWeatherMap API based on user-inputted locations. The script converts the location to coordinates, retrieves the AQI, and provides the current air quality condition. This project earned me 5th place on a Hackathon hosted by HCC's Computer Science Association.
