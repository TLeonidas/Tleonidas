## Hello there!

I'm a sophomore at Houston Community College (HCC) studying AI, and I am passionate about leveraging it for social good! 

Here's a quick overview of my background and interests:

### ðŸ’» Skills
- **Platforms**: AWS, Azure, Google Colab, SageMaker Studio Lab, Hugging Face, GitHub  
- **Languages**: Python, SQL
- **Architectures and Frameworks**: Transformers, PyTorch, CNN
- **Tools and Libraries**: Scikit-learn, NLTK, torchvision, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Gradio  
- **Soft Skills**: Communication, leadership, teamwork, organization

### ðŸ’¡ Projects
- **Detecting Harmful Text in Online Platforms**: Developed a model that achieved 92.5% accuracy, significantly outperforming existing solutions, presented at the annual Gulf Coast Conference & Expo on AI, 2024. 
- **Retrieving Air Quality Index (AQI) through API**: Created a Python script that retrieves AQI data from the OpenWeatherMap API based on user-inputted locations. The script converts the location to coordinates, retrieves the AQI, and provides the current air quality condition. This project was part of the April '24 Hackathon hosted by HCC's Computer Science Association.
