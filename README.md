<h1>Hello there! üëã</h1>
<p>
  I am an Artificial Intelligence practitioner with expertise in Computer Vision and NLP, demonstrated by building a flower classification model and presenting an NLP project at a regional AI conference.
  <br><br>
  I led an engineering team on a NASA proposal (top 7 submissions), and produced and hosted an AI educational show for college television, applying Generative AI across text, audio, image, and video.

## Featured Projects

- [**Flower Classification with Deep Learning**](https://github.com/TLeonidas/uk-flower-classification): For my final project of the AI Programming with Python by Udacity, I applied transfer learning to classify 102 species of flowers by building a custom classifier on top of a VGG16-based neural network. Achieving 85% validation accuracy, I also built a complete training and inference pipeline, including a command-line application.

- [**Detecting Harmful Text in Online Platforms**](https://huggingface.co/spaces/AIGulfCoast2024/Hate_Speech_Text_Classifier): Developed a model that achieved 92.5% accuracy, significantly outperforming existing solutions, presented at the annual Gulf Coast Conference & Expo on AI, 2024.<br>

- [**Air Quality Monitor**](https://github.com/TLeonidas/HCC-CSA-Hackathon): Created a Python script that retrieves Air Quality Index (AQI) data from the OpenWeatherMap API based on user-inputted locations. The script converts the location to coordinates, retrieves the AQI, and provides the current air quality condition. This project earned me 5th place on a Hackathon hosted by HCC's Computer Science Association.
